I'm a software engineer working for Info Support in the Netherlands. I have over 10 years of experience in building distributed systems with Microsoft technology.

Ever since the beginning of my career I’ve had a deep interest in test automation. I’m a TDD enthusiast and in recent years I’ve really come to appreciate Specification by Example and tools like SpecFlow.
