I'm a software engineer working for Info Support in the Netherlands. I have over 10 years of experience in building distributed systems with Microsoft technology.

Ever since the beginning of my career I’ve had a deep interest in test automation because I hate manually checking if an application works. I’m a TDD enthusiast and in recent years I’ve really come to appreciate Specification by Example and tools like SpecFlow.

Just a random thought. Is it a good thing to be an expert in debugging? To me it means you probably inherited a bad piece of code or build it yourself. I think practices like TDD and keeping your code clean can help you stay away from becoming a debugging expert.
